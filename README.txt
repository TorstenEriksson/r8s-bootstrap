THE R8S BOOTSTRAP KIT
---------------------
This loosely connected package of perl scripts may help performing a bootstrap analysis in combination with Mike Sandersons's r8s program and Seqboot (a part of Joe Felsenstein's Phylip package). The aim is to get an estimate of the level of error in divergence time estimates. It may be a complex task, and involves several different programs.

The HOWTO document, the attached scripts and files are intended to help. There is currently no support.

It is not possible to complete a r8s bootstrap by just double-clicking. Follow the step-by-step "guide" at your peril, or find a co-author who is willing to do it.

I have used the scripts with success myself, but not made any thorough effort to test them. Don't bug Mike Sanderson for any mistakes that I may have made here.
